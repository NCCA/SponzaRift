#Sponza Oculus Rift Demo
![alt tag](http://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/GraphicsLib/Demos/Oculus.png)

This builds on the original sponza demo and adds oculus rift support, this is very much 
work in progress and needs quite a bit of tidying up.

You will need to install the oculus SDK and adjust the path in the .pro file to get it working.

This version also loads the binary Model and Material file, you may have to re-create this using the save and load methods as the binary file may not transfer to different operating systems.
